The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Reporting Platform for Jamaica was developed by the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) in collaboration with Mona School of Business and Management (MSBM) using the Open SDG platform. This is  a free-to-reuse platform for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the  [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs).

## The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.  At its heart are the 17 SDGs, a universal call to action to:

  * end poverty
  
  * protect the planet
  
  * improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere

Akin to the development of the SDGs was the development of a monitoring and evaluation framework to assess progress towards attaining the goals and targets. The 17 goals are underpinned by a framework of global indicators that allow Jamaica and other countries to monitor and report on progress. They cover a broad range of social, environmental and economic issues, including but not limited to poverty, hunger, health, education, social equality, innovation, climate change, biodiversity and justice, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. 

## Vision 2030 Jamaica National development Plan

In Jamaica, efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is organized around Vision 2030 Jamaica, the National Development Plan framework. Like the SDGs’ agenda to advance people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership (5Ps), Vision 2030 - Jamaica is the overarching vision for the country which outlines Jamaica’s national goals and outcomes, as well as the country’s guiding principles. 

*“Vision 2030 Jamaica…advancing the achievement of the SDGs…leaving no one behind”!*
